    <h1>WhatsApp Business API</h1>
<p>The WhatsApp Business API is designed for medium and large businesses to manage customer communication at scale through secure, automated, and verified messaging. Unlike the WhatsApp Business app, it offers advanced features such as AI chatbots, CRM integration, and automation, enabling 24/7 customer support and faster query resolution. Businesses can send rich media — including images, videos, and interactive buttons — to create engaging conversations.</p>   
<p>The API supports seamless integration with e-commerce platforms and helpdesks, ensuring every interaction is connected to customer data for a unified experience. With end-to-end encryption, high deliverability, and scalable messaging capabilities, it’s ideal for customer support, order tracking, appointment reminders, and marketing campaigns, making it a powerful tool for enhancing engagement and streamlining communication.</p>
